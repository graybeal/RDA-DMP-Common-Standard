# DMP Common Standard Ontology

This ontology aims to represent the DMP Common Standard model, through the usage of semantic web technology. It represents the DMP Common Standard model using the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/).

This is still a work in progress. The idea behind having the DMP Common Standard model represented in OWL, is to explore the potential behing a machine-readable version of the model.

## Exploring the ontology

There are many tools that allow for the viewing of OWL ontologies. We recomend that you use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/), to open and view the ontology file.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
